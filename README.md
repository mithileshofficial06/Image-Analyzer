# 🖼️ Image Analyzer

**Image Analyzer** is a Python-based project designed for processing and analyzing images with automated insights and report generation. It provides a simple yet extensible framework for extracting meaningful information from images, making it ideal for computer vision experiments, AI-driven research, and academic projects.

---

## 📌 Overview

The Image Analyzer processes input images through a series of preprocessing and analysis steps to extract useful patterns, properties, or metadata. The results can be displayed directly or exported as structured reports. Its modular design allows developers and researchers to easily extend functionality for advanced computer vision or AI-based tasks.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Image Processing** – Load and preprocess images (resizing, normalization, filtering).
- **Automated Analysis** – Extract patterns, visual properties, or metadata from images.
- **Report Generation** – Produce structured outputs summarizing analysis results.
- **Modular Architecture** – Independent components for easy customization and extension.
- **Cross-Platform Support** – Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS using Python 3.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python 3  
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pillow  
- **Environment:** Windows, Linux, macOS  

*(Additional computer vision or AI libraries can be integrated as needed.)*

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. An input image is loaded into the analyzer.
2. Preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, or filtering are applied.
3. The analysis module extracts relevant information or patterns.
4. Results are displayed and can be exported as a structured report.
