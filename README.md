# Image-Analyzer

Image Analyzer is a Python-based project for processing and analyzing images with automated insights and report generation. It provides a simple yet extensible framework for extracting useful information from images, making it suitable for computer vision experiments, AI-driven research, and academic projects.

Key Features

Image Processing: Supports loading and preprocessing of images for analysis.

Automated Analysis: Identifies patterns, properties, or metadata from images.

Reporting: Generates structured outputs or reports summarizing the analysis.

Modular Design: Organized into independent components for easy extension and customization.

Cross-Platform: Works on Windows and Linux with Python 3.

Technology Stack

Programming Language: Python 3

Libraries: opencv-python, numpy, matplotlib, pillow (extendable with other computer vision libraries)

Environment: Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS

How It Works

Load an input image through the analyzer.

Preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, or filtering are applied.

The analysis module extracts information or patterns from the image.

Results are displayed and optionally exported as a report.

Setup

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/mithileshofficial06/Image-Analyzer.git
cd Image-Analyzer


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the analyzer:

python analyzer.py --input sample.jpg

Future Enhancements

Integration with AI/ML models for advanced image classification and object detection.

Support for batch image analysis and large datasets.

Web-based dashboard for visualizing image insights.

Export results in multiple formats (CSV, PDF, JSON).
